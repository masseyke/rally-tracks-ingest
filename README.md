### Data
 
Modifications from the [Web server logs from the 1998 Football world cup](http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/WorldCup.html): 
 
 * Applied "127.0.0.1" for all IP conversions (replaced the integer placeholder)
 * Skipped any log entry that would not result in valid UTF-8 encoding  
 * Transformed the source data to a bulk-friendly JSON format, with "message" as key
